## Overview

The runtime (`gaming_robot_arm/runtime.py`) orchestrates three subsystems:

- **Vision** detects round tokens, labels them, and tracks motion using OpenCV (`vision/figure_detector.py`) plus a centroid tracker (`tracker.py`).
- **Calibration** aligns camera pixels with robot coordinates via a lightweight interactive workflow (`calibration.py`).
- **Control** wraps the uArm Swift API with guard rails for safe motion (`control/uarm_controller.py`).

Together they enable the arm to understand the board layout, plan safe moves, and actuate the gripper, laying the groundwork for full game play such as Nine Men’s Morris or chess.

## Features

- Real-time video capture, visualization, and MP4 recording with minimal buffering.
- Adaptive board and figure detection tuned for circular tokens.
- Persistent tracking IDs and color counts for each detection frame.
- Calibration pipeline that stores labeled board pixels and camera→robot homography matrices.
- High-level robot controller with workspace validation, safe move profiles, and emergency stop.
- Example scripts for freeform moves, coordinate moves, and transferring pieces between labeled locations.

## System Architecture

```
Camera → vision.recording → vision.figure_detector → tracker.CentroidTracker
      ↘ display & MP4 writer          ↘ VisionControlRuntime handlers ↘ control.UArmController
```

Frame handlers decouple the runtime from downstream consumers (e.g., movement planners) so you can add automation without touching the capture loop.

## Hardware & Software Requirements

- uArm Swift Pro with vacuum gripper and USB connection.
- Calibrated overhead or angled camera capable of 1280×720 @ 20 FPS.
- A surface with printed board markings (currently optimized for Nine Men’s Morris A–C rows).
- Windows 10/11 or Linux with Python 3.11+.
- USB bandwidth for simultaneous camera + robot control.
- Optional: tripod/rig to keep the camera rigid during calibration.

## Installation

1. **Clone & enter the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-url> gaming-robot-arm
   cd gaming-robot-arm
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The requirements file installs `git+https://github.com/uarm-developer/uArm-Python-SDK@2.0` in editable mode so the SDK behaves like an external dependency.

4. **Adjust configuration**

   - Edit `config.py` if you need a different camera index, frame size, or uArm defaults.
   - Create the directories referenced in `config.py` if they do not exist (`data/`, `Aufnahmen/`, etc.).

## Quick Start

### 1. Calibrate camera and board

```bash
python calibration.py
```

- Option `1` captures the 24 expected board intersections (labels A1–C8) and stores them in `data/calibration/board_pixels.json`.
- Option `2` fits the camera→robot homography after you enter at least four labeled reference points.
- Option `3` lists existing calibration artifacts.

### 2. Run the live runtime

```bash
python main.py
```

- Streams from `config.CAMERA_INDEX`, detects pieces, and opens OpenCV windows for gray/blur/threshold/processed frames.
- Press `q` (default `stop_key`) to exit.
- The MP4 recording is saved under `Aufnahmen/video_<timestamp>.mp4`. The path is also available via `VisionControlRuntime.last_recording`.

### 3. Move pieces with sample scripts

- `python examples/free_move.py` lets you jog axes using arrow keys (manual control).
- `python examples/move_to_position.py` moves to a single board label once homography data exists.
- `python examples/move_figures.py` prompts for start/end labels and performs a pick-and-place with suction.

Refer to the script docstrings for additional keyboard shortcuts and assumptions.

## Project Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `main.py` | Entry point that boots `VisionControlRuntime` with defaults. |
| `config.py` | Centralized configuration for paths, camera, and uArm safety limits. |
| `gaming_robot_arm/runtime.py` | Capture loop orchestration with pluggable handlers. |
| `vision/` | Board and figure detection, visualization helpers, video recording utilities. |
| `control/` | uArm Swift Pro controller wrapper (`UArmController`, `WorkspaceError`). |
| `examples/` | Ready-to-run scripts for calibration validation and motion experiments. |
| `data/` | Stores calibration data (`data/calibration/*.json`) and raw captures (`data/raw`). |
| `Aufnahmen/` | Default directory for runtime videos. |
| `utils/logger.py` | Logging configuration shared across modules. |

## Development Workflow

1. **Collect data** using `vision/recording.record_dataset` or run-time recordings to refine detection parameters.
2. **Iterate on detection** in `vision/figure_detector.py` and `vision/board_detector.py`, using sample images from `data/raw` to avoid hardware loops.
3. **Extend runtime handlers** by calling `runtime.add_handler()` with functions that react to `VisionArtifacts` and tracker/controller state.
4. **Test robot motions** with `examples/free_move.py` before executing automated scripts.
5. **Log & monitor** via `utils/logger`, which prefixes messages with subsystem information.

## Testing & Diagnostics

- **Dry runs**: Comment out the uArm connection (`controller=None`) to debug the vision stack safely.
- **Camera health**: Use `vision/recording.open_camera()` in an interactive shell to verify FPS and resolution.
- **Workspace bounds**: `UArmController.safe_move()` enforces `config.UARM_MIN_RADIUS`/`UARM_MAX_RADIUS`; catching `WorkspaceError` helps diagnose calibration drift.
- **Performance**: Use OpenCV’s built-in FPS counters (`cv2.getTickFrequency`) if the runtime becomes CPU-bound.

Automated unit tests are not yet included; rely on the above manual checks and share reproducible scripts when submitting contributions.

## Troubleshooting

- **No camera feed**: Confirm `config.CAMERA_INDEX` and check Windows privacy settings; `recording_session` raises a descriptive `RuntimeError` if initialization fails.
- **Board points missing**: Ensure high contrast edges; adjust lighting and retake calibration frames with `calibration.capture_board_pixels()`.
- **uArm not detected**: Pass an explicit `--port` or set `UARM_PORT` in `config.py`; the controller logs the actual USB port upon connection.
- **Robot drifts into unsafe zone**: Re-run homography calibration and verify that `data/calibration/cam_to_robot_homography.json` matches the current board placement.

## Roadmap

Short-term milestones toward playing chess or Nine Men’s Morris live against a human opponent (camera input, uArm output):

1. **Robust board-state modeling** – Track not just circles but also piece identity and move history, enabling rule validation for both games.
2. **Game logic integration** – Embed chess/Nine Men’s Morris engines to compute AI responses and enforce legal moves.
3. **Multi-turn automation** – Extend runtime handlers to queue robot commands, synchronize suction control, and avoid collisions during captures.
4. **Human move recognition** – Enhance `vision.figure_detector` to detect human interactions, pause safely, and resume after the board stabilizes.
5. **User interface** – Provide overlays or web UI with live camera feed, move logs, and AI suggestions.

Community contributions that push the project toward these goals—especially around improved detection, path planning, and UX—are very welcome.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch.
2. Follow the existing code style (type hints, English docstrings, succinct logging).
3. Add or update documentation when changing behavior.
4. Test with both a simulated run (robot disconnected) and hardware run if possible.
5. Open a merge request describing the motivation, approach, and any limitations.

## Previous README (for reference)

# Gaming Robot Arm

Runtime that wires the vision pipeline to the uArm Swift Pro controller.

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements file installs the uArm SDK from the bundled `./uArm-Python-SDK-2.0`
directory in editable mode, so the SDK behaves like an external dependency without
manual `sys.path` tweaks.

## Usage

- `python main.py` launches the vision loop via `gaming_robot_arm.runtime`.
- `python examples/connect_bot.py` verifies uArm connectivity using the same runtime
  orchestration layer.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
